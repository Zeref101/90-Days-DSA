* This code is a C++ implementation of a function isPalindrome that takes a singly-linked list head as an argument and checks whether the linked list is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward.
* The function starts by initializing an empty vector vec to store the values of the nodes in the linked list. Then, it sets a temporary pointer temp to the head of the linked list.
* In the next step, the function loops through the linked list using temp until it reaches the end of the list (i.e., temp becomes NULL). At each iteration of the loop, it appends the value of the current node to the vector vec and advances the temp pointer to the next node.
* Once the vector vec is filled with all the values in the linked list, the function calculates the size of the vector and sets two index variables start and end to the beginning and end of the vector, respectively.
* Finally, the function loops through the vector vec using the start and end variables. At each iteration of the loop, it checks whether the value at index start is equal to the value at index end. If they are not equal, the function returns false because the linked list is not a palindrome. Otherwise, it advances start and decreases end by 1 and continues to the next iteration.
* If the function completes the loop without returning false, it means that the linked list is a palindrome, and the function returns true.
