* This code implements the solution to the "Add Two Numbers" problem on LeetCode, where we are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contains a single digit. The task is to add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list in reverse order.
* The solution uses a dummy node to store the sum, and a temporary pointer to traverse the dummy node. It also uses a variable "carry" to keep track of any carry that may occur during addition of digits.
* The solution starts by initializing the dummy node and temporary pointer to it. Then, it loops through the two input linked lists and the carry variable until they all become null or 0. During each iteration, it adds the corresponding digits from the two linked lists and the carry variable. If the sum of digits and carry is greater than or equal to 10, it sets carry to 1 and adds the remainder to the new node's value. Otherwise, it sets carry to 0 and adds the sum to the new node's value. The new node is then added to the temporary pointer's next and the temporary pointer is updated to the newly added node.
* Finally, the function returns the next node of the dummy node as the head of the new linked list representing the sum of the two input linked lists.
