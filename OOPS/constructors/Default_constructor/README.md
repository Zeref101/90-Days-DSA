A default constructor is a constructor that is automatically generated by the compiler if no other constructor is defined for a class. The default constructor has no parameters and initializes the member variables of the class to their default values.
## EXAMPLE
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Person {
public:
    string name;
    int age;

    // Default constructor
    Person() {
        name = "John Doe";
        age = 0;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create an instance of the Person class using the default constructor
    Person p;

    // Print the values of the member variables
    cout << "Name: " << p.name << endl;
    cout << "Age: " << p.age << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
* Person class has a default constructor that initializes the name member variable to "John Doe" and the age member variable to 0.
* In the main function, an instance of the Person class is created using the default constructor.The values of the member variables are then printed to the console using cout. Since no values were assed to the constructor, the default values are used. 
## POINTS TO BE NOTED
* When you define a constructor for a class, you are telling the compiler how to initialize the member variables of the class. If you don't define a constructor, the compiler will generate a default constructor that initializes the member variables to their default values.
* However, if you define a constructor with one or more parameters, the compiler will not generate a default constructor. This means that if you want to create an instance of the class without passing any parameters, you will need to define a default constructor explicitly.
```cpp
class Person {
public:
    string name;
    int age;

    // Constructor with parameters
    Person(string n, int a) {
        name = n;
        age = a;
    }

    // Default constructor
    Person() {
        name = "John Doe";
        age = 0;
    }
};
```
